# Printing a string variable without new line


# Input string from user and prints it
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, " + name) # Concatenating strings is one way to use print()
print("hello,", name, name)  # This is the simplest way to use print() -> adds " " automatically between each arguments
print(f"hello, {name}") # This is the formatted way to use print()
