# Lectures

## [Lecture 0: Functions, Variables](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/0/)

### [Concepts](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/)
- [First Program](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#creating-code-with-python): *code prog_name.py* to create an empty python program -> *python prog_name.py* to run the program.
- [Functions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#functions): are known actions that have side effects and can take arguments. Functions are used to modularize code (even within libraries). From the function's perspective the input variables are called *parameters*, but from the program's perspective that calls the function the input variables are called *arguments*. Positional parameters must be passed in the same order as they appear in the function signature, whereas named parameters can be passed in any order (defined by their specified name!). The position is not relevant for named parameters, but after them no positional parameter can be passed. Used functions: *print()*, *input()* (ALWAYS sanitize user input properly!). Functions can be called right after each other: *name = name.strip().title()*.
- [Bugs](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#bugs): are mistakes identified by the compiler with a cryptic, but useful message. Solve them to make a working or better program.
- [Variables](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#variables): are containers for values. Used data types: *int*, *float*, *str*. Used *str* methods: *isalpha()*, *strip()*, *title()*, *split()*. Used numeric methods: *int()*, *float()* type converters, *round()*.
- [Comments](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#comments): are notes for programmers (ignored by interpreter). Single-line comments are created using the "#" symbol. Multi-line strings are enclosed in triple quotes (""" ... """ or ''' ... '''). Docstrings are strings used to document modules, classes, functions, and methods. They are written as the first statement in the function, method, class, or module definition and are enclosed in triple quotes. Docstrings can be accessed programmatically via the __doc__ attribute and are a key part of Python's documentation system.
- [Escape Character](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#a-small-problem-with-quotation-marks): "\\" (*backslash*) used for special characters.
- [Formatting Strings](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#formatting-strings): *print(f"hello, {name}")* where *f* is a special indicator for Python to treat this string a special way. *{name}* is a variable in this case. See documentation for mini language!
- [Formatting Numbers](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#float-basics): separator for groups of three digits, starting from the decimal point and moving left: *print(f"{x:,}")*. Show decimals (2): *print(f"{x:.2f}")*. Show max (10) decimals, but exclude unnecessary "0": *print(f"{x:.10g}")*.
- [User Functions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#def): created with *def* keyword and indentation to understand what is part of the function. To add default values to function parameters assign them in function declaration. A *main()* function is recommended to be created and called in a python program. A function can return one variable. This ‚Äúpassing back‚Äù value is called a *return* value.
- [Interactive mode](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/0/#integers-or-int) is a feature of Python where code can be executed interactively in terminal. Enter *python* in terminal and ">>>" will appear for this feature.

### [Problem Set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/)
- [Indoor Voice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/indoor/): a python program that converts user input into lowercase.
- [Playback Speed](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/playback/): a python program that outputs the same input, replacing each space with "...".
- [Making Faces](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/faces/): a python program that changes ":)" to üôÇ and ":(" to üôÅ.
- [Einstein](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/einstein/): a python program that determines energy based on mass.
- [Tip Calculator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/tip/): a python program that calculates tips depending on dollar amounts and percentages.


## [Lecture 1: Conditionals](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/1/)

### [Concepts](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/1/)
- **Conditionals**: allow the program to make decisions. *Mathematical operators* consist of "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "==" and "!=". *Boolean operators* consist of *and*, *or*, *not*., comparisons
- **if statements**: use boolean values (*true* or *false*) to decide whether or not to execute the code. elif, else
- pythonic way to implement conditional
- match and case (similar to switch and case from Java)

### [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/)
